## Overview

Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical in healthcare, especially for potentially life-threatening medical conditions like brain aneurysms. Brain aneurysms (or intracranial aneurysms) are focal dilations in the arteries of the brain that may not show symptoms initially but can be deadly if not diagnosed accurately and treated appropriately.

Experienced radiologists can detect aneurysms on images of the brain, but they can be easily overlooked, particularly when imaging studies are performed for other purposes. Rapid and accurate automated detection of aneurysms on routine brain imaging studies could help prevent devastating outcomes for patients.
